            Aviation, a field encompassing the design, development, and operation of aircraft, plays a crucial role in connecting people and places across the globe. From its pioneering days with the Wright brothers' first powered flight in 1903 to today's advanced commercial jets and cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicles, aviation has transformed how we travel, conduct business, and respond to emergencies. The industry relies on a complex interplay of engineering, technology, and regulation to ensure safety, efficiency, and innovation.
