              The Merchant Navy refers to the commercial fleet of ships and vessels engaged in transporting goods and passengers across international waters. Unlike naval forces, which are primarily focused on defense and military operations, the Merchant Navy operates in the commercial sector, providing crucial logistical support to global trade. Merchant Navy personnel, including deck officers, engineers, and ratings, play vital roles in the safe and efficient operation of these vessels.
